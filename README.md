### Title of the Project
# Nifty50 Price Forecasting Using ARIMA Model

### Description
This project utilizes the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model to forecast the Nifty50 stock index prices. The primary objective is to showcase the application of ARIMA, a sophisticated statistical method, in predicting future stock prices based on historical data. This serves as a crucial tool for financial analysis and strategic decision-making in financial markets.

### Files in the Repository
- `Price_Forecasting_using_Time_Series_Model_ARIMA.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook includes all the code, models, and visualizations developed for this project.

### Methodology
- **Data Collection**: The data was sourced from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library, focusing on the historical prices of the Nifty50 index.
- **Data Preprocessing**: We ensured data quality by checking for missing values and employing cleaning functions to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Modeling**: The `auto_arima` function from the `pmdarima` library was utilized to automatically determine the optimal ARIMA model parameters, streamlining the model selection process.
- **Evaluation**: The trading strategy was simpleâ€”buy when the predicted next day's closing price was higher than the current day's, and sell otherwise. The strategy's performance was benchmarked against the traditional buy-and-hold approach using metrics like overall returns, drawdown, and the Sharpe ratio.

### Results
The traditional market approach yielded a return of 19.5% with a drawdown of 7%. In contrast, our ARIMA-based strategy achieved a 22% return with only a 5% drawdown, and a Sharpe ratio exceeding 2. This demonstrates the efficacy of the ARIMA model in enhancing return profiles under specified market conditions.

### Conclusion
The ARIMA model proved to be a potent tool in forecasting financial markets, offering improved predictive accuracy over several traditional statistical models. This project underscores the potential of ARIMA models in developing advanced trading strategies that can outperform standard market approaches.
